Other than installing dependencies, you'll need to place the pdf you want to convert in the same folder and rename it to "audio.pdf".
The bigger the pdf, the longer it'll take to convert since I did not add threading yet :P
You can listen to the mp3 file as it's converting in case you get bored though
